    <li><strong>1884</strong> - He received a BA (Natural Sciences Tripos) from the University of Cambridge and a BSc from the University College London affiliated under University of London in 1884</li>
    <li><strong>1894</strong> - Jagadish Chandra Bose was first to use a crystal as a radio wave detector, using galena detectors to receive microwaves starting around 1894</li>
    <li><strong>1895</strong> - In 1895, he was the first to demonstrate the wireless transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves at Presidency College (now Presidency University), Kolkata.</li>
     
    <li><strong>1899</strong>- Initiated detailed study of coherer leading to his discovery of the common nature of the electrical response to all forms of stimulation, in animal and plant tissues as well as in some inorganic models.</li>
    <li><strong>1902</strong> - He continued efforts to device inorganic models of the biophysical phenomena underlying electrical and mechanical responses to stimulation, the transmission of excitation in plant and animal tissues and of vision and memory. </li>
    <li><strong>1907</strong> - 1907-1933 During this period he devoted himself mainly to the study of response phenomena in plants, the complexity of whose responses lies intermediate between those of inorganic matter and animals.</li>
     <li><strong>1917</strong> - On 30'th November 1917, he founded the Bose Institute in Calcutta. On this occasion, he delivered his famous address "The voice of life" and dedicated the institute to the service of the nation.</li>
